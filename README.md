Computer Vision is the emerging field of computer science making it possible for digital world to interact with physcial world. 
Today I have made a gesture volume control system using computer vision. I have used packages and Libraries like pycaw, mediapipe and openCV.

I have made a standalone hand tracking module "HandTrackingModule and deployed it in this code by importing it at the start of the code. I am also uploading that module on
